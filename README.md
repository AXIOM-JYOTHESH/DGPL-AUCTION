# DGPL Auction - Real-Time Player Auction Platform

🔗 **[Live Demo](https://dgpl-auction.tech)** <!-- Replace with your actual live URL -->

## Introduction

DGPL Auction is a full-stack, real-time web application designed to digitize and streamline the player auction process for the Dussehra Gulteez Premier League (DGPL), a cricket tournament organized by the Telugu student community at MNIT Jaipur. This project replaces the traditional manual auction with a secure, engaging, and interactive online platform, enabling seamless management and participation for admins, team captains, and viewers.

Built to solve a real-world problem, this application transforms the auction experience from a chaotic offline process into a smooth, transparent, and exciting digital event that brings the community together.
